Variable can simply refer to place holders meaning they allow you to store values 
in them.

They act as boxes that cann allow you to store items of different data types in them.
in javascript we have two types of variables:
    1.variables that are declared with var
    2.variables that are declared with let

Those declared with var keyword are global variables meaning they can be used in any scope.
    Example: var name = "John";
    Example: var age = 23;
    These variables can be used within any function or block of code, they are not limited to the scope of the function or block of code.

Those declared with let keyword are local variables meaning they can only be used in the scope they are declared in.
    Example: let name = "John";
    Example: let age = 23;
    These variables can only be used within the block of code they are declared in, that is they can not be used in any other block of code.
